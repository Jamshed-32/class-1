		<p><b><i>Life is only as complicated as you make it,” my mom would always say to me.</i></b>
		My life has been great so far, then bad at times. But in retrospect my life may seem better than others. Although that may be the case, my life isn’t as perfect as it may appear.
		Being me I had to go through a father-less childhood with a “pop-up father”, brainless injuries, and horrifying memories. 
		I was born November 5, 1997, in San Pablo, California. My mother, Chablis,<br> and father, Damon, never got along after my birth. Till this day my father isn’t in my life. 
		My mother has always taken care of me and my other five siblings as we lived in Richmond, California at the time. 
		As far as I can remember my childhood was amazing. Spending time with my family, enjoying the days as they passed was amazing.
		Having five other siblings didn’t always mean fun and excitement 24/7. There were times where we didn’t fancy each other’s company. 
		I can remember the best time we had with each other<br>, it was about seven years ago, December 25, Christmas was great that year. There were an abundance of gifts for and from everyone.
		We played with the toys for hours, all day long. That was the first time when it was one day of happiness that lasted the entire day. We moved from Richmond over to Rodeo, California for quite some time. 
		Rodeo was a small city, filled with violence and crime. In the part we lived in was safe from that though.</p>
